A set of specialized python scripts made to recovery important text files from damaged or lost file systems.

## Intro

This tool is specialized in searching for a few important text or code files.

It will search the entire HD looking for the selected patterns,
group all files found with these patterns and sort them according to how likely
it is that it is the file you are looking for.

The API is not friendly yet, but hopefully it will in future.
